# Introduction

OpenWrap is an extension of Prebid now (since version [6.1.0](https://github.com/PubMatic/OpenWrap/releases/tag/ExtPrebid_v6.1.0_NIGHTLY)) and uses Prebid as the core library for all partner integration.

Portions of OpenWrap contain code from Prebid.js licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

As publishers have embraced header bidding, running multiple header tags from different providers has become a top priority with many considerations.

The main areas of concern are:

*   Code conflict
*   Inability to control timeouts efficiently
*   Development time required per integration
*   Lack of holistic insights and analytics
*   Changing the page and tag structure to accommodate for header tag.

We came up with a simple way to use wrapper tags which solves for all the issues above and most importantly, was specifically designed to be plug-and-play with the GPT tags.

What this means for publishers:

*   No changes to GPT structure
*   No coding required to get and push bids to GPT (not even setting targeting)
*   Works with standard as well as advanced GPT implementations.

All the publisher has to do is push the wrapper script and partner configuration live on the page and you are done. It’s that simple. The script takes care of detecting what ad units, divs and sizes are on page, fire up calls to desired partners and attach bids to DFP calls as key-values.

# Design and Execution Flow

# <span style="font-size: 20.0px;line-height: 1.5;">Interaction with GPT tag</span>

*   Wrapper script interacts with GPT tags by overriding basic GPT functions like display(), refresh() ... 
*   The original display calls to DFP are put in queue until all the Wrapper partners are called for bid or desired timeout is reached.
*   Final auction between the bids takes place and the highest bid is pushed as key-value to DFP
*   Here is the flow diagram for someone who wants to have a look at the code and understands what is happening inside the hood.

# Getting Started

Please note that, OpenWrap extending PreBid code is in ***src_new*** folder the code in original src folder is deprecated now and will eventually will be removed and replaced with code in src_new folder.

## PreBid Fork:

We have created a fork from PreBid repo: https://github.com/PubMatic-OpenWrap/Prebid.js which OpenWrap uses as core and is used for building the library.
The fork has PreBid Version [1.9.0](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/tag/1.9.0) which will be upgraded frquently to latest PreBid version.

## Configuration Exchange between OpenWrap and Prebid

All partners from PreBid listed [here](http://prebid.org/dev-docs/bidders.html) can be used with OpenWrap. Refer [build](https://github.com/PubMatic-OpenWrap/Prebid.js#Build) section to configure adapters to use with PreBid.

Please refer [src_new/conf.js](https://github.com/PubMatic/OpenWrap/blob/ContinuousIntegration/src_new/conf.js) in OpenWrap code:

```


## Default PreBid settings

*   Namespace: window.pbjs0 , namepaces will be generated dynamically everytime we call requestBids API, example: pbjs0, pbjs1 and so on.
*   Bidder Sequence: random
*   Logging: false by default, will be set to true if pwtvc/pwtc is used in page URL

## PreBid  API's used:

*   `window.pbjs.setBidderSequence("random");`
*   `window.pbjs.logging = false;`
*   `window.pbjs.requestBids({...});`
*   `window.pbjs.onEvent('bidResponse', function(bid){});`

## Supporting Advanced GPT setup
Advanced GPT implementation where publishers define and display slot on the fly WAS NOT supported due to PreBid [limitation](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/issues/914)
Now we create Prebid namespaces at run time every time we need to call requestBids() API. As the requestBids() API method in two different namespace does not wait for call to complete execution. So for first call namespace would be pbjs0 , for second call namespace would be pbjs1 and so on. Due to creating multiple namespaces, Prebid's debug script may not work.

## Logging Post-timeout bids
We use the event, bidResponse, provided by Prebid.
pbjs.onEvent('bidResponse', function(bid){}); gets bid from every partner even it comes post timeout. Please note that only the bids coming before TIMEOUT + 2 seconds will be logged in logger pixel.


### Combinations of KGP to PreBid code:

For a slot with,
*   AdUnit ID: /43743431/DMDemo1
*   AdUnit Index: 0
*   Sizes: [[300, 250],[728,90],[160, 600]]
*   Div ID: Top_Banner_1

There is a partners configured, AppNexus
Following are the different cases of KGP and code value:

| Index | Mapping Template | OpenWrap KGP | OpenWrap KGP Example | PreBid Code | PreBid Code Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1|Div Level|`_DIV_`|`Top_Banner_1`|`_DIV_@_AdapterID_`|`Top_Banner_1@appnexus`|
|2|AdUnit-Size |`_AU_@_W_x_H_:_AUI_`|`/43743431/DMDemo1@300x250:0`  `/43743431/DMDemo1@728x90:0` `/43743431/DMDemo1@160x600:0`|`_DIV_@_AdapterID_@_Width_x_Height_`|`Top_Banner_1@appnexus@300x250` `Top_Banner_1@appnexus@728x90` `Top_Banner_1@appnexus@160x600`|

## How To Build

Building process of OpenWrap and Prebid.js has been automated with shell script named build.sh/build.cmd.
Please use shell script for the same with desired mode and parameters supported.
Shell script to execute gulp job :
*   For Unix: build.sh
*   For Windows: build.cmd

This particular shell script named "build.sh" or "build.cmd" can be triggered to generate OpenWrap distribution. Output file will be at path /build/owt.js
It accepts two parameters -

*   **mode**: Its value can be either "build" or "test-build" .
    On passing the mode parameter with value "build", the shell script will generate production ready code , without running tests.
    On the other hand when mode parameter has "test-build" value, the shell script will run tests along with generation of dev version of the build.

*   **prebidpath**: This should be the relative path of Prebid repo on local machine.

Tools Required to build:
```
npm install gulp -g
npm install gulp-cli -g
```

Then chekout Prebid (currently fork of v1.9.0 is supported) on desired location:
```
git clone https://github.com/PubMatic-OpenWrap/Prebid.js
```
Run npm install in Prebid as well as OpenWrap Folder


Build with test:
```
./build.sh --mode=test-build --prebidpath=../Prebid.js/
```
Build for dev(Use this for local builds):
```
./build.sh --mode=dev-build --prebidpath=../Prebid.js/
```
Build for production:
```
./build.sh --mode=build --prebidpath=../Prebid.js/
```


## Deploy

The generated script should be deployed on a test page before trying it on production.
You can load the generated minimized js either synchronously or asynchronously on your pages.
To load minimized js synchronously, you can use below tag in the header section of your test page-

    <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/owt.combine.min.js"></script>


And to load minimized wrapper js script asynchronously before GPT using callback, you can use below tag-

    <!--GPT Tag with Callback begins here -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var PWT = {}; //Initialize Namespace
        var googletag = googletag || {};
        googletag.cmd = googletag.cmd || [];
        PWT.jsLoaded = function() { // Wrapper tag on load callback is used to load GPT
            (function() {
                var gads = document.createElement('script');
                var useSSL = 'https:' == document.location.protocol;
                gads.src = (useSSL ? 'https:' : 'http:') + '//www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js';
                var node = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
                node.parentNode.insertBefore(gads, node);
            })();
        }
    </script>
    <!--GPT Tag ends here -->
    <!--Wrapper Tag starts here -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        (function() {
            var wtads = document.createElement('script');
            wtads.async = true;
            wtads.type = 'text/javascript';
            wtads.src = 'owt.js';
            var node = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
            node.parentNode.insertBefore(wtads, node);
        })();
    </script>
    <!--Wrapper Tag ends here -->


## Test

You can either test the generated open wrapper tag in your local dev/test environment or if you just want to see how it works, you can refer to the below links to demo pages section that are checked in.

## Auction and Timeout

  ![Auction Logic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PubMatic/OpenWrap/master/images/AuctionLogic.png)

  ***Note***: As of current release, we are not capturing post-timeout bids as depicted in above diagram. We will support the same in subsequent release.

# DFP Setup and Line Item creation

# Ad Server Configuration

## Trafficking Wrapper Line Items

This step is required so the ad server, based on actual bid price, can allocate impressions to the winning partner. These bids are passed using key-value pairs added to the ad server tags dynamically, as explained in the previous sections.


**Step 1:** Create a new order in DFP for a Wrapper as OpenWrap as the advertiser and add the relevant details.


![New Order](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PubMatic/OpenWrap/master/images/New%20Order.jpg)


**Step 2:** Set the price and priority of the line items.  

![Step 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PubMatic/OpenWrap/master/images/LineItem.jpg)


**Step 3:** Set targeting on the “pwtbst” value as 1 from the. In addition to  “pwtbst”,  you will also need to set targeting on “pwtecp”.  For more information, please refer to the [Best Practices to Create Line Items]

![Step 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PubMatic/OpenWrap/master/images/Targeting.jpg)


**Step 4:** Add the Wrapper creative provided by PubMatic to the line item you created. 

    <script type='text/javascript'>
    var i = 0, w = window.self;
    while(w!== window.top && !(w.PWT && w.PWT.displayCreative) && i<10){
     w = window.self.parent; i++;
    }
    try{ w.PWT.displayCreative(document, '%%PATTERN:pwtsid%%'); } catch(e){}
    </script></script></pre>


## Best Practices for Creating Granular Line Items

**Note: If DFP is the ad server,</span>** **<span>ensure the line items do NOT have the Google safe frame setting enabled.</span>** >
After June 27th, 2016, line items are automatically created in DFP with safe frame enabled by default. This setting will cause the creative to appear as blank. This requires that users manually uncheck "safe frame," regardless of whether it was manually or automatically enabled.

To control monetization through OpenWrap at a granular level, you may:

*   Create multiple line items in the ad server for each ad unit/ad size/CPM range/geo.
*   Use “**pwtecp**” as the targeting attribute.
*   Place the line items at different priorities based on the desired configuration.

While creating line items at multiple price points, we recommend you create line items with more granular pricing where the bid density is high.

**For example:**

If 80% of the bids are between $0 to $3, create line items at a $0.1 granularity. For other ranges you can create line items at a coarse granularity.

Please see more details below. 

**30 line items between $0-$3 with rate increment of $0.1**

LineItem 1 (covers $0-$0.09)  Targeting: pwtecp=0.01*,pwtecp=0.02*....,pwtecp=0.09*, rate=$0.05

LineItem 2 (covers $0.10-$0.19) Targeting: pwtecp=0.1*, rate=$0.15

and so on for next 28 line items


**15 Line items between $3-$8 with rate increment of $0.30**

LineItem 31 (covers $3.0-$3.29)  Targeting: pwtecp=3.0*,pwtecp=3.1*,pwtecp=3.2*, rate=$3.15

LineItem 32 (covers $3.30-$3.59)  Targeting: pwtecp=3.3*,pwtecp=3.4*,pwtecp=3.5*, rate=$3.45

and so on for next 13 line items   


**12 Line items between $9-$20 with rate increment of $1.0**

LineItem 46 (covers $9.0-$9.99)  Targeting: pwtecp=9.*, rate=$9.5

LineItem 47 (covers $10.0-$10.99)  Targeting: pwtecp=10.*, rate=$3.45

and so on for next 10 line items   


**A final high- priority line item for very high bids**

Line Item 58 (Covers $20 and above) Targeting : pwtecp=20*,pwtecp=21*,pwtecp=22*...... pwtecp=50*) rate= $21

<span class="s1">Note for reporting on specific key-value, both the key and value need to be predefined in DFP.</span>

<span class="s1">Also if you are targeting multiple deals to that line item, you will then need to do one more modification. You will need to add a second deal as</span> <span class="s4">**pwtbst**=1</span> <span class="s5">AND</span> <span class="s1">**pwtdid**=DealID1</span> <span class="s6">OR</span> <span class="s1">DealID2 and your order would look like this:</span>
